As a paleoclimatologist and geochemist who studies fossil soils, one thing we often look at is the stable carbon isotopic composition (d13C) of soil organic matter. However, because these are old soils, most of the organic matter have been either oxidated or comsumed by soil microorganisms, and the remaining organic carbon content (TOC) can be so low (<0.1%ï¼‰that introduces signifcant uncertainty to the measured d13C. 
In terms of carbonate-containing soils, we need to remove the carbonate before measurement, because the d13C of soil carbonates are much higher than those of soil organic matter. This is especially important for low TOC paleosols, since a tiny bit of carbonate could lead to a hugh bias. The most common way of removing carbonate is called "acid wash", which
