After all the tedious paperwork and preparation and waiting, We finally and safely arrived! Starting now, I will be working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, working with Prof. Dan Breecker. 

The whole journey began almost a year ago, when Dan sent me an email, asking me if I am interested in applying for a postdoctoral fellow funded by the NSF-FRES project called [CO2PIP (CO2 Proxy Integration Project)](https://paleo-co2.org/co2pip), the primary goal of which is to compile and modernize existing CO2 records throughout the Phaneroiz Era. Thinking of the opportunities to meet and learn from the best scientists within the paleo-{{< math >}}$CO_{2}${{< /math >}} community, I know this is an offer I simply could not resist. However, such a life-changing decision cannot be made by myself. I vividly remember it was a Sunday morning, so I immediately told my wife after receiving this email. She supports me 100 percent as always, and the rest is history. 

Cannot wait to begin this new chapter of life!
