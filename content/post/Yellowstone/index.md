The City Austin is cut in half by the meandering Colorado River, which is great for the people living in here to enjoy a bit of coolness during the long, unbearably hot summer.

People have been recommending me to kayak ever since we arrived. A friend who used to live here told me he even bought a kayak. However, he soon moved to the Mountainous Boulder and the kayak naturally retired after its short-lived duty.  
Anyway, we decided to give it a try on a Friday afternoon. We rent a kayak at Zilker park and navigated through a narrow tributary filled with unknown aquatic plants, which could easily intertwine with the paddles. 
We paddled 4 miles all the way to the Lady Bird Lake, where you are supposed to see thousands of bats flying out of the Congress Avenue Bridge at sunset. 
Unfortunately, we arrived too early for both the sunset and the bats. So next time, then! 
It was fun and we will defintely come again.
