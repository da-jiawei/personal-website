My wife and I went on another national park tour to Yellowstone, the most famous NP known to the Chinese, as well as Grand Teton. I've known the Yellowstone and the Old Faithful since I was in elementary when reading **One Hundred Thousand Whys** - the most popular science book for children. The Yellowstone was then buried in my memory for a long time until during my undergraduate when it was reintroduced to me as the **infant** of plate tectonics, after the **kid** Great Rift Valley, the **teenager** Atlantic Ocean, the **adult** Pacific, the **mid-aged** Death Sea, and the **old-man** Tibetan Plateau. The circle of life. Anyway, as I finally got the chance to visit a childhood dreamland, I was pretty excited with high expectations. The reality, however, is always more complicated. So here are some suggestions for those who plan to visit in the future:
- if you encounter a traffic jam inside Yellowstone, 9/10 it is because of bison crossing the road. So stay patient, and take out your cameras to capture some wildlife.
- Bring a binocular with you, spend a whole afternoon in the Hayden Valley and you will have twice more fun
- Check out if there is any wildfire in Canada, which could bring haziness to the sky
- The Old Faithful is indeed magnificent, so try to come 10-20 min earlier than the forecast time and secure a first-row seat.
- The Grand Prismatic is also spectacular, but do go to the Fairy Falls Trailhead for an overlook
- Don't forget to check out some falls in Yellowstone, they are just as gorgeous as the hot springs
- Go on a cruise around Jenny lake, try asking so tricky geology questions to the guide, like what kind of rocks were the Grand Teton made of?
- kayak on the Jenny Lake if you arrive between June and November
- have a picnic at any of the turnout points inside the Grand Teton
