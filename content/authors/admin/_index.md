Jiawei Da is a postdoctoral research fellow working at the University of Texas at Austin. His research interests include soil science, low-temperature stable isotope geochemistry, carbon cycle, and paleoclimate. His current research mainly focuses on the reconstruction of late Cenozoic atmospheric $CO_{2}$ levels, using paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau.
