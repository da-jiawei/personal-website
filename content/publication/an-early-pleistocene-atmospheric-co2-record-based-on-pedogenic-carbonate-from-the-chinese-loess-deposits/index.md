abstract: The tight coupling between temperature and atmospheric CO2 is shown by
  ice core records for the past 0.8 million years (Myr). However, the modern
  atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) has exceeded previous interglacial
  pCO2 levels over the past 0.8 Myr, suggesting that the earlier part of the
  Pleistocene and Pliocene might be a better analog of today's radiative forcing
  of CO2. The early Pleistocene experienced a constant cooling characterized by
  the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciations. Existing pCO2 records
  developed from marine organic matter and inorganic precipitates, however,
  disagree with the trends and absolute values of CO2 over this time interval.
  Here we present quantitative interglacial pCO2 estimates from  Myr using the
  stable carbon isotopic compositions of pedogenic carbonates collected from the
  Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Our pCO2 records provide the first documentation
  of pCO2 from continental sedimentary deposits over the early Pleistocene. The
  successive decrease of our pCO2 records is broadly consistent with the
  increase in deep-sea  and the overall decline of sea surface temperature (SST)
  at this time, but in contrast with the increasing peak interglacial pCO2
  recorded in ice cores for the last 0.8 Myr.
