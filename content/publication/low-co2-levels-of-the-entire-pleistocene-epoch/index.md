abstract: Quantifying ancient atmospheric pCO2 provides valuable insights into
  the interplay between greenhouse gases and global climate. Beyond the 800-ky
  history uncovered by ice cores, discrepancies in both the trend and magnitude
  of pCO2 changes remain among different proxy-derived results. The traditional
  paleosol pCO2 paleobarometer suffers from largely unconstrained soil-respired
  CO2 concentration (S(z)). Using finely disseminated carbonates precipitated in
  paleosols from the Chinese Loess Plateau, here we identified that their S(z)
  can be quantitatively constrained by soil magnetic susceptibility. Based on
  this approach, we reconstructed pCO2 during 2.6–0.9 Ma, which documents
  overall low pCO2 levels (<300 ppm) comparable with ice core records,
  indicating that the Earth system has operated under late Pleistocene pCO2
  levels for an extended period. The pCO2 levels do not show statistically
  significant differences across the mid-Pleistocene Transition (ca.
  1.2–0.8 Ma), suggesting that CO2 is probably not the driver of this important
  climate change event.
